# WebPhue

An attempt at a webapp for controlling Philips Hue bulbs

My previous project for controlling Hue bulbs was command line. It does the job, but is limited in what 
it can do, and the user has to remember the commands.  What about a slick UI with drag-and-drop, click on icons
and color pickers, and using Svelte?

WORK IN PROGRESS.
